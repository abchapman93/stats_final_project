    "## Abstract\n",
    "*Free-text reports in electronic health records (EHRs) contain medically significant information - signs, symptoms,\n",
    "findings, diagnoses - recorded by clinicians during patient encounters. These reports contain rich clinical\n",
    "information which can be leveraged for surveillance of disease and occurrence of adverse events. In order to gain\n",
    "meaningful knowledge from these text reports to support surveillance ef orts, information must first be converted\n",
    "into a structured, computable format. Traditional methods rely on manual review of charts, which can be costly and\n",
    "ineficient. Natural language processing (NLP) methods offer an efficient, alternative approach to extracting the\n",
    "information and can achieve a similar level of accuracy. We utilized statistical and probabalistic methods to examine properties of radiology reports and determine whether or not text-based Machine Learning (ML) algorithms could effectively classify reports containing evidence of surgical site infections leveraging these mentions. We evaluated our system using a reference standard of reports annotated by domain experts and test for statistical significance.*"

    "## Task Overview\n",
    "SSIs are adverse outcomes of surgeries. There are multiple of SSIs and they can result in rehospitalization or death. Many SSIs occur after discharge and so they are difficult to detect. Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers a way to automatically and effectively detect surgical site infections. In this project we will be focusing on Deep/Organ Space SSIs, which are often identified in radiology reports as **collections of fluid.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a past project that was presented at AMIA [see *Discussion/References - 10*], a rule-based NLP system to identify fluid collections in radiology reports was developed. A hand-crafted lexicon was used to identify mentions of fluid collection. This lexicon terms such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"fluid collection\"\n",
    "- \"hematoma\"\n",
    "- \"abscess\"\n",
    "- \"biloma\"\n",
    "- \"multiloculated fluid\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This lexicon was handcrafted by having clinicians hand-annotate data. Creating such detailed annotations was a costly and difficult process. The purpose of this project is to use a much coarser annotation as labels: a binary decision of whether or not a fluid collection is present. We will then use probablistic methods to identify salient terms that could belong to the lexicon and then train Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to make this distinction between positive and negative reports."
